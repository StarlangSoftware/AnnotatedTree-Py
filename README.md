# Constituency TreeBank

A treebank is a corpus where the sentences in each language are syntactically (if necessary morphologically) annotated. In the treebanks, the syntactic annotation usually follows constituent and/or dependency structure.

Treebanks annotated for the syntactic or semantic structures of the sentences are essential for developing state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems including part-of-speech-taggers, syntactic parsers, and machine translation systems. There are two main groups of syntactic treebanks, namely treebanks annotated for constituency (phrase structure) and the ones that are annotated for dependency structure.

## Data Format

We extend the original format with the relevant information, given between curly braces. For example, the word 'problem' in a sentence in the standard Penn Treebank notation, may be represented in the data format provided below:

	(NN problem)

After all levels of processing are finished, the data structure stored for the same word has the following form in the system.

	(NN {turkish=sorunu} {english=problem} 
	{morphologicalAnalysis=sorun+NOUN+A3SG+PNON+ACC}
	{metaMorphemes=sorun+yH}
	{semantics=TUR10-0703650})

As is self-explanatory, 'turkish' tag shows the original Turkish word; 'morphologicalanalysis' tag shows the correct morphological parse of that word; 'semantics' tag shows the ID of the correct sense of that word; 'namedEntity' tag shows the named entity tag of that word; 'propbank' tag shows the semantic role of that word for the verb synset id (frame id in the frame file) which is also given in that tag.

Detailed Description
============

+ [TreeBankDrawable](#treebankdrawable)
+ [ParseTreeDrawable](#parsetreedrawable)
+ [LayerInfo](#layerinfo)

## TreeBankDrawable

To load an annotated TreeBank:

	TreeBankDrawable(folder: str, String pattern: str)
	a = TreeBankDrawable("/Turkish-Phrase", ".train")

	TreeBankDrawable(folder: str)
	a = new TreeBankDrawable("/Turkish-Phrase")

To access all the trees in a TreeBankDrawable:

	for i in range(a.sentenceCount()):
		parseTree = a.get(i);
		....
	}

## ParseTreeDrawable

To load a saved ParseTreeDrawable:

	ParseTreeDrawable(file: str)
	
is used. Usually it is more useful to load TreeBankDrawable as explained above than to load ParseTree one by one.

To find the node number of a ParseTreeDrawable:

	nodeCount() -> int
	
the leaf number of a ParseTreeDrawable:

	leafCount() -> int
	
the word count in a ParseTreeDrawable:

	wordCount(excludeStopWords: bool) -> int
	
above methods can be used.

## LayerInfo

Information of an annotated word is kept in LayerInfo class. To access the morphological analysis
of the annotated word:

	getMorphologicalParseAt(index: int) -> MorphologicalParse

meaning of an annotated word:

	getSemanticAt(self, index: int) -> str

the shallow parse tag (e.g., subject, indirect object etc.) of annotated word: 

	getShallowParseAt(self, index: int) -> str

the argument tag of the annotated word:

	getArgumentAt(self, index: int) -> Argument
	
the word count in a node:

	getNumberOfWords(self) -> int

For Contibutors
============

### Setup.py file
1. Do not forget to set package list. All subfolders should be added to the package list.
```
    packages=['Classification', 'Classification.Model', 'Classification.Model.DecisionTree',
              'Classification.Model.Ensemble', 'Classification.Model.NeuralNetwork',
              'Classification.Model.NonParametric', 'Classification.Model.Parametric',
              'Classification.Filter', 'Classification.DataSet', 'Classification.Instance', 'Classification.Attribute',
              'Classification.Parameter', 'Classification.Experiment',
              'Classification.Performance', 'Classification.InstanceList', 'Classification.DistanceMetric',
              'Classification.StatisticalTest', 'Classification.FeatureSelection'],
```
2. Package name should be lowercase and only may include _ character.
```
    name='nlptoolkit_math',
```

### Python files
1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    def __broadcast_shape(self, shape1: Tuple[int, ...], shape2: Tuple[int, ...]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
        """
        Determines the broadcasted shape of two tensors.

        :param shape1: Tuple representing the first tensor shape.
        :param shape2: Tuple representing the second tensor shape.
        :return: Tuple representing the broadcasted shape.
        """
```
2. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    def addItem(self, item: str):
```
3. Local variables should follow snake case.
```
	det = 1.0
	copy_of_matrix = copy.deepcopy(self)
```
4. Class variables should be declared in each file.
```
class Eigenvector(Vector):
    eigenvalue: float
```
5. Variable types should be defined for function parameters and class variables.
```
    def getIndex(self, item: str) -> int:
```
6. For abstract methods, use ABC package and declare them with @abstractmethod.
```
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, train_set: list[Tensor]):
        pass
```
7. For private methods, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
    def __infer_shape(self, data: Union[List, List[List], List[List[List]]]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
```
8. For private class variables, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
class Matrix(object):
    __row: int
    __col: int
    __values: list[list[float]]
```
9. Write \_\_repr\_\_ class methods as toString methods
10. Write getter and setter class methods.
```
    def getOptimizer(self) -> Optimizer:
        return self.optimizer
    def setValue(self, value: Optional[Tensor]) -> None:
        self._value = value
```
11. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    def constructor1(self):
        self.__values = []
        self.__size = 0

    def constructor2(self, values: list):
        self.__values = values.copy()
        self.__size = len(values)

    def __init__(self,
                 valuesOrSize=None,
                 initial=None):
        if valuesOrSize is None:
            self.constructor1()
        elif isinstance(valuesOrSize, list):
            self.constructor2(valuesOrSize)
```
12. Extend test classes from unittest and use separate unit test methods.
```
class TensorTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_inferred_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        self.assertEqual((2, 2), a.getShape())

    def test_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        self.assertEqual((3, ), a.getShape())
```
13. Enumerated types should be used when necessary as enum classes.
```
class AttributeType(Enum):
    """
    Continuous Attribute
    """
    CONTINUOUS = auto()
    """
    Discrete Attribute
    """
    DISCRETE = auto()
```
